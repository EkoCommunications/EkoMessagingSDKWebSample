# Install

Add this to package.json:
`"flobx": "git+https://9d06aec30678b868385ac9890babf56528ddff6e:x-oauth-basic@github.com/EkoCommunications/flobx"`

> Make sure to run `npm run build` after every change so the latest compiled version is uploaded to github. 
> In the future, it would be good to have a `prepare` script to do this automatically, however there are issues where the `prepare` script does not run when installing from github url: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/19684
